        <h:p>Toplevel dictionary for computational chemistry</h:p>
        <h:p>
            Concepts in this dictionary are general throughout computational chemistry and
            are used extensively in CMLComp convention to describe the structure of
            computational chemistry.

                A quantum chemistry calculation is often comprised of a series of subtasks,
                <h:i>e.g.</h:i> coarse optimisation -> fine optimisation -> NMR Spectrum Analysis; this is
        because most quantum chemistry software packages are designed to be
        modularised and only to perform a single task at a time. The joblist concept
        is introduced to capture these series of successive subtasks and links
        the information from one subtask to the next subtask.

        <h:p>
            The job concept represents a computational job performed by quantum chemistry
            software, e.g. geometry optimisation job, frequency analysis job. The job
            concept is the smallest unit which can fully describe a general picture of
            computational modelling.

        <h:p>

        <h:p>
            The computing environment concept refers to a hardware platform, software application, 
            the operating system and any hardware and software configurations used in order to run 
            the job or computational task. The environment also includes the metadata such as 
            machine id, username, starting and finishing date time, tools, compilers, IP, etc.
        </h:p>
        <h:p>   
            This information is not related to input and output of the model but is supplementary to 
            the software application to run properly and may vary from machine to machine. 
            Therefore, the computing environment is OPTIONAL element in the CompChem convention.
