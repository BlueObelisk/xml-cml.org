            <h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

            <ol class="bibliography">
            <li>Q. What is CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML (Chemical Markup Language) is an XML language designed to hold
            most of the central concepts in chemistry.
            It was the first language to be developed and plays the same role for
            chemistry as <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a> for mathematics and
            <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml">GML</a> for geographical systems.
            </p>

            <li>Q. What does CML cover?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML covers most mainstream chemistry and especially molecules,
            reactions, solid-state, computation and spectroscopy. Since it has a
            special flexible approach to numeric science it also covers a very
            wide range of chemical properties, parameters and experimental
            observation. It is particularly concerned with the communication
            between machines and humans, and machines to machines. It has been
            heavily informed by the current chemical scholarly literature and
            chemical databases.
            </p>

            <li>Q. What is a CML 'element'?</li>
            <p>
            A. XML defines a vocabulary through 'elements'. This unfortunately
            clashes with the concept of chemical element so we use the term
            <code>CMLElement</code> to represent the XML vocabulary. There are
            about 120 <code>CMLElement</code>s and most of them have
            straightforward names representing well-understood concepts
            (<em>e.g.</em> <code>product</code>, <code>plane3</code>). Most users
            will only need the subset of <code>CMLElement</code>s relevent to
            their discipline.
            </p>
    
            <li>Q. How long has CML been going?</li>
            <p>
            A. Since 1994. It has had several versions which have expanded its
            content and increased the rigour and semantic power.
            </p>

            <li>Q. Is CML 'stable'?</li>
            <p>
            A. Yes. The last major content revision was about 5 years ago, and the
            software design has been stablefor approximately the same period.
            </p>

            <li>Q. Why do I need CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML is becoming the <em>lingua franca</em> for the formal
            representation of chemistry in modern information systems. Most people
            will not interact directly with CML but will increasingly use systems
            which rely on it for their implementation.
            </p>

            <li>Q. How do I use CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. Most people will use software without realising that it is based on
            CML. If you are a developer or manage a data resource then you will
            almost certainly use existing libraries rather than having to build
            software from scratch.
            </p>

            <li>Q. Who uses CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. Effectively all Open Source chemistry projects (such as in the <a href="http://blueobelisk.org">Blue
            Obelisk</a>) use CML. It is not yet universal in closed commercial
            products although we know anecdotally that many systems can use CML,
            and that many companies use it internally. As an example, we have
            worked with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a> to develop a 
            <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/chem4word/">CML plug-in for Word</a> and
            are working with a number of organisations such as chemical companies
            and national laboratories to develop systems based on this.
            </p>

            <li>Q. Where can I see examples of CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. Because CML is so flexible, it's similar to asking 'where can I see
            examples of mathematical equations?' Our publications normally include
            significant snippets of CML with descriptions of their purpose. There
            are a large number of CML resources mentioned in later sections. We
            also ensure that all concepts in CML are supported by examples
            co-published with the schema.
            </p>

        <h2><a name="special">What's special about CML?</a></h2>

            <li>Q. Why can't we use existing systems?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML is a very powerful language for representing complex concepts
            in a completely precise and validatable manner. Most other systems
            rely on implicit semantics (<em>e.g.</em> units are not given and the
            meaning of quantities can only be determined from manuals or reading
            the source code). CML provides self-describing documents and data, and
            means that groups who have never worked together before can understand
            each other's information. Because it's in XML, it is straightforward
            to integrate CML with other XML languages such as MathML, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a>
            (graphics), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_XML_formats">WordML</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML">OOXML</a>, 
            and <a href="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook</a>/<a href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM-XML (from the NIH)</a>.
            </p>

            <li>Q. What does 'extensible' mean for CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML provides an abstraction of numerical science and so rather than
            having special markup for a melting point, it describes it as a scalar
            property defined by a dictionary entry. This means that users can add
            more properties to CML simply by creating and using their own
            dictionaries.
            </p>

            <li>Q. How does CML control the spread of dictionaries?</li>
            <p>
            A. It doesn't. Anyone can create a dictionary but they have to use a
            unique namespace (probably based on their domain name). This means
            that there is no ambiguity since every item is precisely defined.
            Dictionaries are a major part of the CML activity and we have software
            to support their creation and validation.
            </p>
            <p>
            The <code>CMLElement</code>s have evolved and been designed to provide
            a toolkit for describing a very wide range of chemical concepts. It is
            therefore likely that you will be able to express a new concept using
            the existing <code>CMLElement</code>s rather than inventing new ones.
            However, there will always be a small demand for new elements but you
            should remember that each new element requires support by software to
            be useful.
            </p>

            <li>Q. How does CML manage numeric quantities?</li>
            <p>
            A. A very wide range of numerical quantities can be broken down into
            the data type and the dimensionality. CML supports 5 data types at
            present (string, integer, real number, Boolean and date), and uses the
            W3C definitions and software to support these. CML provides three
            dimensionalities: zero (scalar), one (homogeneous array) and two
            (rectangular matrix). This covers a very wide range of concepts found
            in chemical documents and databases. Some concepts, such as boiling
            point, require two primitive elements: parameter and property. The
            parameter describes the constraining pressure while the property
            supports the temperature. Again, we have found that a wide range of
            chemical concepts can be created from primitive components.
            </p>

            <li>Q. If everyone makes up their own concepts, don't we get chaos?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML manages concepts and documents through the deployment of <a href="/conventions/">conventions</a>.
            </p>

            <li>Q. What's a convention?</li>
            <p>
            A. A convention is an agreement by a sub-community to use particular
            structures and constraints for documents, <code>CMLElement</code>s and
            attributes.
            </p>

            <li>Q. How does CML manage conventions?</li>
            <p>
            A. A convention consists of a formal specification, understandable by
            humans and precisely processable by machines. Each convention has a
            namespace so that it is always clear which convention is enforced.
            Namespaces can be combined, for example by nesting, so that simple
            conventions can be used by more complex ones.
            </p>
            <li>Q. What's validation?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML encourages and increasingly requires documents to be valid
            against a convention. This means that if you use software which reads
            and writes a CML document, the software knows what's in the document
            from the convention. In this way, software designers can create tools
            which can be guaranteed to perform correctly on valid documents. If a
            document has an unknown convention, or an unsupported one, the
            software can ignore part or all of the document without crashing.
            </p>

            <li>Q. What's a 'datument'?</li>
            <p>
            A. A <a href="http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/article/viewArticle/130">'datument'</a> is the combination of all the components of a piece of
            scientific information into a single flexible CML object, possibly
            using hyperlinks. It challenges the traditional separation of
            documents and data, and can be used to disply information to both
            humans and machines in the most effective manner.
            </p>

        <h2><a name="chemistry">Chemistry</a></h2>

            <li>Q. What types of chemistry does CML support?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML can support much of the current scientific literature and most
            undergraduate chemistry. Much of this is already possible but some
            will require additional software and conventions to be built.
            </p>

            <li>Q. How does CML support molecules?</li>
            <p>
            A. A molecule is a very general term and does not imply any particular
            use of chemical bonds or representation. At its simplest, a molecule
            contains atoms and may optionally contain bonds between those atoms.
            Molecules can also contain other molecules, so that salts or liganded
            proteins can be described by nested molecules. Molecules often contain
            property elements and can also be associated with, for example,
            spectra. The molecule is re-used by other concepts in CML such as
            reaction.
            </p>
            <p>
            A molecule can be represented at many levels of detail. At its
            simplest, it may have just an id, then perhaps a title or inline
            formula, and then be extended to provide atoms, the bonds between them
            and the coordinates and other properties. <a
            href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/chem4word/">Chem4Word</a>
            allows a wide range of different representations for the molecule
            concept.
            </p>

            <li>Q. How does CML support reactions?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML uses the traditional concepts of product and reactant, and can
            associate a wide range of properties with either. There are a number
            of concepts such as reaction list, reaction step which allow complex
            sequences of reactions to be described. For example, CML can represent
            a synthetic scheme or the precise reaction mechanism of a single
            reaction. Reactions can have properties such as temperature and
            observations such as the length of time for which a reaction took
            place.
            </p>

            <li>Q. How does CML support crystal structures and solid state chemistry?</li>
            <p>       
            A. CML supports crystal structures with specific elements such as
            crystal and symmetry, which supports most of the common
            crystallographic data and operations. This is also enough to support
            modelling of the solid-state, both completely periodic and also
            partially periodic (1-D and 2-D). There is a large collection of
            crystal structure (<a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye/">CrystalEye</a>) where the original CIF files have been
            converted to CML.
            </p>

            <li>Q. How does CML support spectroscopy?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML has specific elements (spectrum and peak) which are used to
            describe a wide range of 1-D spectra (<em>e.g.</em>IR, UV, CD
            <em>etc.</em>) It is straightforward to devise conventions for 2-D
            spectra. There are collections of peaks published (such as <a href="http://nmrshiftdb.nmr.uni-koeln.de/">NMRShiftDB</a>)
            but few Open collections of continuous 1-D spectra. However, a number
            of national laboratories are now planning to use CML to manage their
            analytical spectroscopy.
            </p>

            <li>Q. How does CML support computational chemistry?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML provides a number of tools (module, list) to structure the
            output of computational processes, both QM and empirical. We have
            written converters (parsers) for several well-known codes and this
            means that the information in the logfile becomes immediately much
            more valuable. We are also working with program authors (<em>e.g.</em> <a href="http://www.nwchem-sw.org/">NWChem</a>,
            <a href="http://www.ccp5.ac.uk/DL_POLY/">DL_POLY</a>) to embed CML routines within the code so that they
            automatically generate CML.
            </p>

            <li>Q. Can CML be used with other disciplines, such as bioscience?</li>
            <p>
            A. Yes. Because CML has its own namespace, it can be included anywhere
            in other XML documents, and the processors may choose either to
            include it as part of the information or to ignore it. CML is part of
            the <a href="http://www.biopax.org/">BioPAX</a> standard and we have also been involved in the <a href="http://mibbi.org/index.php/Projects/MIABE">MIABE</a>
            activity.
            </p>

            <li>Q. What's missing from CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. We are currently working on the representation of forcefields in
            CML and mapping chemical reactions onto kinetic equations. These
            involve more complex semantics but it should be possible to use the
            existing range of <code>CMLElement</code>s. There is no immediate
            apparent need for new elements, although in some cases (<em>e.g.</em>
            concentrations) it could simplify the representation.
            </p>

            <li>Q. Are there alternatives to CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. CML deliberately does not duplicate other established efforts, so
            we use basis sets from the EMSL basis set exchange rather than using
            our own markup. We continue to use our own definition for scientific
            units until <a href="http://unitsml.nist.gov/">UnitsML</a> becomes widely deployed and supported by software.
            We note the existence of <a href="http://animl.sourceforge.net/">Analytical Information markup language (AnIML)</a> which
            takes  somewhat different approach and which is yet to be deployed in
            significant volume. We also note the successful <a href="http://old.iupac.org/namespaces/ThermoML/">ThermoML</a>, used for
            describing thermochemical data published in several journals.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is theoretically possible to describe semantics in a more explicit
            form by using <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> and ontologies (<em>e.g.</em> <a href="http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3714/version/1">ChemAxiom</a>). 
            Our current view is that this is too complex for the chemical community to take onboard, and provides
            little effective added value over our hard-coded and rule-based semantics.
            </p>

        <h2><a name="software">Software</a></h2>

            <li>Q. Where do I download CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. You don't. CML does not exist as a binary package. The uses of CML
            are very varied so people and applications will require their own
            selection of tools. The <a href="/tools/software.html">JUMBO and JUMBO-Converters</a> represent an
            implementation for the whole of CML and an important part of its
            existence is to act as a reference, defining the semantics where they
            are not trivially interpretable from the specification.
            </p>
            <p>
            The formal schema specifications are <a href="/schema/">available for download</a>.
            </p>

            <li>Q. What software do I need to use CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. The commonest operations in CMl will be creation, transmission,
            reading, tranformation, editing, computation, searching and display.
            Most applications have a small subset of this. For example, a <a href="http://quixote.ch.cam.ac.uk/">Quixote
            repository</a> is based on the <a href="http://www.chempound.net/">Chempound</a> software which provides
            validation, ingest, indexing,searching and display. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/chem4word/">Chem4Word</a> provides
            the creation of molecules, the integration of documents and CML and a
            rich set of display options in the widely-distributed Word
            environment. <a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye/">CrystalEye</a> trawls the public scientific literature for
            crystal structures which it converts into CML and displays on browsable
            pages. Many programs such as <a href="<a href="http://www.ccp5.ac.uk/DL_POLY/">DL_POLY</a> now emit CML as a primary
            representation of computational results. The <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/MACiE/">MaCiE system</a> annotated
            enzyme reaction mechanisms and provided animated graphical
            representation of the reaction. There are a vast number of different
            ways of combining the tools in CML systems to provide a very large
            range of chemical applications.
            </p>

            <li>Q. How do I write CML software?</li>

            A. Wherever possible, you should build on an existing library and use
            existing web services. The libraries ensure not only syntactic
            validity of the CML but also increasingly support conventions and
            other chemical operations. Not all functions are available in all
            languages so you may need to refer to some existing implementations
            and port parts of the code. Because XML is designed as the 'digital
            dialtone of the Web' (Jon Bosak) it is the means of choice for
            supplying information from web services. Frequently it is preferable
            to use existing web services rather than try to write functionality
            from scratch. For example, our <a href="http://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/">OPSIN</a> server will supply chemical name
            to structure conversion on demand.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you do have to write CML software then we provide a range of
            examples and tools to help with the validation.
            </p>

            <li>Q. What tools and groups include CML in their applications?</li>
            <p>
            A. In 2011 there were over 20 independent Open Source chemistry
            systems and most of these have facilities for CML. The most central is
            probably <a href="http://openbabel.org/">OpenBabel</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdk/">CDK</a> probably has the richest chemical
            functionality. <a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net/">Jmol</a> and <a href="http://avogadro.openmolecules.net">Avogadro</a> are very high-quality display and
            analysis tools.
            </p>

            <li>Q. How do I create documents containing CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. The <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/chem4word/">Chem4Word</a> system is an example of an integrated chemistry and
            text editor, where the result is held completely in XML. The code is
            all Open and it will be technically possible to port most of the
            functionality to OpenOffice. In many cases the document will be
            created by automated aggregation and editing of components, of which
            CML will be one. Thus, for example, XML stylesheets could be used to
            include CML into documents conforming to the NLM-DTD.

            <li>Q. Where can I find molecules in CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. <a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye/">CrystalEye1</a>, <a href="http://crystaleye.ch.cam.ac.uk/">CrystalEye2</a> and <a href="http://quixote.ch.cam.ac.uk">Quixote</a> servers have tens or hundreds
            of thousands of molecular structures. It is straightforward to convert
            other legacy formats <em>e.g.</em> MDL <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file">molfiles</a> or <a href="http://www.cambridgesoft.com/software/ChemDraw/">ChemDraw</a> files to CML using
            OpenBabel, CDK or JUMBO-Converters.
            </p>

            <li>Q. Where can I find reactions in CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. Reactions are not yet widely represented in chemistry because there
            are very few examples of collections of Open reactions that we can
            process without legal constraints. We have, however, extracted a large
            number of reactions from the patent literature (the <a href="http://greenchain.ch.cam.ac.uk/">Green Chain Reaction</a>)
            and the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/MACiE/">MaCiE database</a> contains enzyme reactions and mechanisms.

            <li>Q. Where can I find spectra in CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. There are none (yet).
            </p>
            <li>Q. Where can I find crystal structures in CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. The original <a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye/">CrystalEye project</a> contains approx. 250,000 crystal structures 
            converted into CML. 
            </p>

            <li>Q. Where can I find computational chemistry in CML?</li>
            <p>
            A. The aim of the <a href="http://quixote.wikispot.org/">Quixote project</a> is to transform and <a href="http://quixote.ch.cam.ac.uk">aggregate compchem results</a> into 
            a browsable and searchable <a href="http://www.chempound.net/">Chempound</a> repository.
