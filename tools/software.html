    <h1>CML-aware software</h1>
    <p>
    This page contains information about and links to CML-aware software, developed in the Murray-Rust group and elsewhere.
    </p>
    
    <h2><a name="jumbo" class="internal-link">Jumbo</a></h2>
    <p>
    "JUMBO" is a collective term for CML-aware software components. They are intended to
    be definitive for the CML language, and provide validation and examples. CMLXOM and
    JUMBO are available under SCM on
    <a href="http://cml.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cml/">Sourceforge</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>CMLXOM</h3>
    <p>
    CMLXOM represents an in-memory and serializable CML object of any complexity.
    In general CML can be read into CMLXOM and processed with Java code or XPath expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
    The code consists of components directly supporting the elements and attributes in CML. Every
    element has a Java class, e.g.:
    <br />
    <code>&lt;molecule></code> is supported by <code>CMLMolecule.java</code>
    <br />
    <code>&lt;basisSet></code> is supported by <code>CMLBasisSet.java</code>.
    <br />
    In general the classes support management of
    required or common childElements, required or common attributes.
    <p>
    CMLXOM does not support complex chemical calculations (which are in JUMBO and
    JUMBOConverters). For example CMLXOM will support the management of bond information
    but not the generation of SMILES.
    </p>
    <h3>JUMBO</h3>
    <p>
    JUMBO provides a large set of "tools" which generally support the CMLXOM classes but
    also provide general functionality. Typically:
    <br />
    <code>CMLMolecule.java</code> is supported by <code>MoleculeTool</code>
    <br />
    <code>CMLReaction.java</code> is supported by <code>ReactionTool</code>
    <br />
    These might provide, respectively, molecular geometry, fragment analysis, properties;
    and stoichiometry, identification of catalysts, <i>etc</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>JUMBOConverters</h3>
    <p>
    A large set of modular components for carrying out 1:1 transformations. The simplest
    are Foo2CMLConverter and CML2FooConverter where Foo is a legacy format. This supports
    major formats in:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>crystallography</li>
        <li>computational chemistry</li>
        <li>molecules</li>
        <li>reactions</li>
        <li>spectroscopy</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="chem4word" class="internal-link">Chem4Word</a></h2>
    <p>
    The <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/chem4word">Chemistry Add-in for Word</a>
    (Chem4Word) is an Open Source (Apache 2.0) program that makes it easier to insert and
    modify chemical information, such as
    labels, formulas, and 2D depictions, within Microsoft Office Word. Additionally, it
    enables the creation of inline "chemical zones", the rendering of print-ready visual
    depictions of chemical structures, and the ability to store and expose chemical
    information in a semantically rich manner.
