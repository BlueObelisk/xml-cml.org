        There are several versions of the CML schema. The current version is Schema 3.
    </p>

    <h1>Schema 3</h1>
    <p>
        Schema 3 is a refinement of <a href="schema24/">Schema 2.4</a>. Much of the
        content model has been removed as have those elements and attributes which were deprecated
        in the previous version.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only content model retained in Schema 3 is for elements which must be empty
        or elements which must contain string content. All other elements are permitted
        to contain any other CML element and/or and elements from a different namespace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Schema 3 may be viewed <a href="schema3/">here</a> and downloaded by
        clicking this <a href="schema3/schema.xsd">link</a>. Examples of
        how to represent chemistry in CML conforming to Schema 3 are available
        <a href="/examples/schema3/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>Schema 2.4</h1>
    <p>
        The last stable release was
        <a href="http://cml.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cml/schema2/trunk/">Schema 2.4</a>
        and has remained unchanged since 2005.
    </p>
    <p>
        Schema 2.4 may be viewed <a href="schema24/">here</a> and downloaded by
        clicking this <a href="schema24/schema.xsd">link</a>. There are many examples of
        how to represent chemistry in CML conforming to this schema available
        <a href="/examples/schema24/">here</a>. All these examples should also
        validate against Schema 3.
