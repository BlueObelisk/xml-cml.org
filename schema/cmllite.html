    <h1>A new approach to validation</h1>
    <p>
        CML has previously been defined using DTDs and schemas.
        As part of the <a href="http://chem4word.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Chem4Word project</a> a new approach
        to the validation of Chemical Markup Langauge (CML) has been taken. The validation is now performed by a series
        of Schema, XSLT and code. Each step of the validation process puts progressively tighter restrictions on the
        structure and content of the document.
    </p>

    <h2>CMLLite Schema - Vocabulary</h2>
    <p>
        We are currently using <a href="/schema/schema3/">Schema 3</a> for the schema validation step of the CMLLite
        process. This schema is based on the long stable <a href="/schema/schema24/">Schema 2.4</a> but the content
        model has been largely removed and deprecated elements and attributes have also been removed. We are still
        cleaning up the schema (espcially the documentation) and intend to denormalise the attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The content model determines what types of content element and attributes can hold. Previously the Schema
        allowed mixed content (both text and elements) for some elements; this is no longer allowed. Elements are
        specified as being allowed either no content, text content or element content. In some cases the text content
        or element content is mandatory in others it is optional. Any element which is allowed element content may now
        hold any other CML element or any element from a different namespace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Schema 3 has added the explicit <code>unknown</code> value to many enumerations. In Schema 2.4 elements and
        attributes specified an empty string as allowed content which was interpretted to mean unknown or unspecified.
        This has been replaced by the string value <code>unknown</code>. This allows the absence of the element or
        attribute to be interpretted as unspecified.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previous schemas allowed values to be either from an enumeration or a
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/" target="_blank">QName</a>. For example the list below shows
        some of the allowed values of the <code>order</code> attribute on a <code>bond</code>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>S</code> (single)</li>
        <li><code>D</code> (bond)</li>
        <li><code>T</code> (triple)</li>
        <li><code>A</code> (aromatic)</li>
        <li><code>QName</code> allows users to point to another bond type which is not supported by CML</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The <code>order</code> attribute could therefore have either string or QName content. Schema 3 now specifies
        the allowed values as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>S</code> (single)</li>
        <li><code>D</code> (bond)</li>
        <li><code>T</code> (triple)</li>
        <li><code>A</code> (aromatic)</li>
        <li><code>unknown</code> - an unambiguous statement that the order of the bond is unknown</li>
        <li><code>other</code> - any other bond order. The <code>dictRef</code> attribute may be used to add further information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="conventions">Conventions and Constraints - Grammar</a></h2>
    <p>
        Different domains of chemistry think about chemistry differently; often this means a very tight specification
        of rules in <i>your</i> area of expertise and very little if any applied to the rest. The loosening of the
        content model in Schema 3 allows users to combine the elements and attributes as they need to represent data.
        However, users still need to be able to specify a set of rules (constraints) which model their particular
        domain. This can be likened to thinking of the elements and attributes of CML as representing the allowed
        vocabularly and the set of rules as a grammar specifying how these words are allowed to be put together.
        The entire set of constraints which the CML should conform to is called a <code>convention</code>. There are
        currently three well developed conventions <code>molecular</code>, <code>compchem</code> and
        <code>dictionary</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Constraints are defined by using <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/" target="_blank">XSL Transformations</a>
        (XSLT). These allow users to put more specific constraints and co-constraints on the allowed structure of the
        CML documents than using only schemas. We an output based on the
        <a href="http://www.schematron.com/spec.html" target="_blank">ISO Schematron standard</a> XML report language
        SVRL (Schematron Validation Report Language) to indicate errors and warnings in the document. A major advantage
        of this approach is that all the errors and warnings are reported rather than the validation process stopping
        as soon as the first error has been found.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of constraints implemented in the <code>molecular</code> convention are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>an <code>atomArray</code> must have at least one <code>atom</code> child</li>
        <li>the value of an <code>atom</code>s <code>id</code> must be unique within the eldest containing molecule</li>
        <li>a <code>bond</code> element must have an <code>atomRefs2</code> attribute</li>
        <li>a <code>bond</code> must be between <code>atom</code>s within the same molecule</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are also <a href="/examples/">examples</a> of files which conform to the various levels of validation
        available with some explanation <a href="/examples/schema3/">here</a>.
