    <h1>Examples for Schema 3</h1>
    <p>
        Schema 3 is a less restrictive schema than Schema 2.4, designed to be used with conventions as part of
        <a href="/schema/cmllite.html">CMLLite</a>. The loosening of the restrictions in the schema mean that it is
        valid to create documents which do not make chemical sense. For example molecules being the children of atoms
        and bonds being defined in a molecule with no atoms present. However, the inclusion of conventions allows us
        to place much tighter constraints and co-constraints on the structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Owing to the looser content model of Schema 3 it is less meaningful to give examples of how the elements and
        attributes may be combined than it is for <a href="/examples/schema24/">Schema 2.4</a>; hence we only give
        examples of files which are both valid according to the schema but also conform to a specified convention.
        These examples are available by clicking on the links below.
